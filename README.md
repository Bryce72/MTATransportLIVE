# MTA  Transport Live - Java

The goal of this project is to use NYC's MTA publicly accessible API's to 
locate subways/trains. End goal is to adapt this code to run on a conveniently 
hosted server to display on a lowe powered screen. Basically, I want a screen by my front door
telling me when the next train will arrive. 

## Description

For now this project is being set up to run in the terminal alone. Practicing basic Java.
This description will be updated as I go.
